    "Hello World programs are a benchmark for any programming language. Python has one of the simplest \"Hello World\" programs, at just 1 word besides the \"Hello World\" string and a few bits of syntax. Even Java, another very popular, well-maintained, and amazing programming language has a vastly more complicated Hello World program, see: [View Java and other languages' Hello World programs.](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text#Java)\n",
